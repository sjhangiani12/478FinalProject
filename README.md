# The UW Marijuana Study

### Project Description
This is a written, non-technical description of your project. Depending on the specifics of your project, you should outline the answers to these (and perhaps other) questions:

What is the purpose of your research project?

There has been an ever increasing use of marijuana among the youth as well as many US states are formalizing laws that legalize the use of recreational marijuana. The purpose of this research project is to study the effects of Marijuana on developing adolescent brains. In particular, we would like do an analysis on the current studies related to the effects of THC - the primary component of the drug - on the brain, and then try to discover correlations between marijuana smoking habits and overall health. We would have to roll out surveys for current smokers in the university or any other related casualties.

What other research has been done in this area?

Make sure to include 3+ links to related works.
There has been a lot of research in this area but the long term effects of marijuana on the human brain still remains inconclusive. Most papers cite negative effects of marijuana on the brain with consequences like slow reaction time, less memory retention etc. On the other hand there are also a fair amount of articles that cite positive effects of marijuana for mental health such as reduced anxiety, stress and PTSD.

What is the dataset you'll be working with?

Please include background on who collected the data, where you accessed it, and any additional information we should know about how this data came to be.
For this particular study there is not a single dataset that would suffice our research project. In fact there doesn’t exist any datasets that have long term use case and effects of marijuana that we can work with. Instead we would like to work with two different kinds of datasets and then join them to find any actionable insights.

1) Data related to the amount/total consumption and frequency of Marijuana in teens and young at a national level

2) Survey conducted at UW 

Who is your target audience? Depending on the domain of your data, there may be a variety of audiences interested in using the dataset. You should hone in on one of these audiences.


Our target audience is young people (high school and college) who would want to learn more about the possible effects of marijuana on their brains. This study could be applicable to both smokers as well as non smokers who could use the study to learn a better picture of the true effects of marijuana. Another audience could be parents and elderly people who might either themselves be marijuana users or be concerned about the health of their children and young people around them. Overall, we need to create more awareness about the effects of marijuana to the youth.

What should your audience learn from your resource? Please consider specific questions that your project can answer using the data you have identified (that are related to the overarching purpose)

Our audience should learn about the direct impact of the use of marijuana on youth. Specifically, we want to be able to provide direct answers to questions posed regarding the impact of marijuana use on health. Furthermore, we want to provide tangible ideas to help those who are using marijuana to become aware of the effects the drug has on their bodies.

### Technical Description

This section of your proposal is an opportunity to think through the specific analytical steps you'll need to complete throughout the project.

What will be the format of your final product (Shiny app, HTML page, compiled .Rmd file, etc)?

Our final project would be a website rendered from Webflow.io

Do you anticipate any specific data collection / data management challenges?

Working with multiple academic papers and generating combined insights

What new technical skills will need to learn in order to complete your project?

Some group members might need to get familiar with pandas. Moreover, we would have to learn how to create new metrics. We’ll also have to learn how to use different types of visualizations. These will be of different complexities and will need different packages we haven’t worked with before.

What major challenges do you anticipate?

There is a wide range of data that exists in this space, and each of them has been collected differently, with different nuances. It’s important that we understand the exact context and nuances for the specific data/metrics that we end up using. Trying to make the right assumptions and normalizing the data will be both difficult and important.
